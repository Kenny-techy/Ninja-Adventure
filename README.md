# Ninja-Adventure
Ninja Adventure is a 2D platformer developed in Unity using C# as part of my BTEC Computing Game Development assignment. In the game the player controls a ninja who must complete timed levels by avoiding hazards, defeat enemies, collect coins, and unlocking doors to progress. Each level increases in difficulty through additional hazards, enemies, and reduced completion time.  Key Features:  Player movement and combat system  Enemy AI with multiple states (idle, attack, chase, throw)  Health system with dynamic UI health bar  Score system linked to coin collection and level progression  Countdown timer with time-based score bonuses  Power-ups and checkpoint system  Sound effects and background music managed through a custom audio manager  Settings menu with volume control for improved accessibility  The game was designed for a target audience of 8–12-year-olds, featuring a colourful 2D cartoon art style and an intuitive user interface to ensure accessibility and engaging gameplay.
